## Predicting non-functional water pumps in Tanzania

This project is for a competition from drivendata.org.  

Using data on water pumps in communities across Tanzania, can we predict the pumps that are functional, need repairs, or don't work at all?

The data: Competition for [drivendata.org](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/). Contains a mix of continuous and categorical variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, how it was managed, etc.

## Documents  
preprocessing.py contains functions for preprocessing data.  
WaterPumps.ipynb goes through exploratory analysis and cata preprocessing.  
WaterPumpsII.ipynb has model training and evaluation.
